This folder contains the files for optimisation task as written by
Veronika Ulanova.

IMPORTANT: No install.sh file was produced as these files were created
on a windows laptop. Instead you will find the requirments.txt that has 
information about the dependencies needed. To install them just use 
the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt

run.py - contain the code with just the latest optimisation algorithm. 
Please see the Minimisation_progress.ipynb file to see all algorithms
that were attempted and their performances. It also contains interactive
plots of the functions. If you are unable to open any of the files for
any reason please go to this github repository to access them.
